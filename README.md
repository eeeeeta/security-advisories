# Security Advisories

This repository contains security advisories for all Jitsi projects.

## Reporting security issues

We take security very seriously and develop all Jitsi projects to be secure and safe. Jitsi projects are developed
by humans, and humans make mistakes, however.

If you find (or simply suspect) a security issue in any of the Jitsi projects, please report it to us via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/8x8) or send us an email to **security@jitsi.org**. Thank you!

**We encourage responsible disclosure for the sake of our users, so please reach out before posting in a public space.**
