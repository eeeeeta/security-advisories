## Overview

* **Project**: jitsi-meet-electron
* **Summary**:  Multiple Remote Code Execution issues
* **Severity**: High
* **Affected versions**: All < 2.3.0
* **Fixed date**: 2020-07-01
* **Fixed version**: 2.3.0
* **CVE**: N/A
* **Reported by**: Juho Nurminen (Mattermost)

## Description

Multiple issues that could yield to Remote Code Execution (RCE) have been found:

- RCE via UNC paths: an atacker with a modified Jitsi Meet server could use the exposed
`shellOpenExternal` function to open a custom binary in the user's path.
- RCE via lack of consent in remote control: an attacker could run a modified Jitsi Meet server to trigger a user
into enabling remote control and thus execute remote commands.
- RCE via prototype pollution: an attacker with a modified Jitsi Meet server could use prototype pollution to bypass
checks in `shellOpenExternal` and thus result in RCE.

## Resolution

- Restricted URLs which will be opened externally: https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron/commit/962470d97e8faefa5728ff4c324ce387cfd456e0
- The external API is now bundles so no remote code is executed on the user machine outside of the iframe: https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron/commit/c4aefb05b5404cfc9b7c0e25eb3bb638684beb48
- Remote Control has been disabled: https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron/commit/0b88a783f3f7658d7e04e8a868ffbb4b56b77c7b
